If someone says something you don't understand, here on the List, on the floor, or just about life in NYC, you can ask one of your fellow students for an explanation by sending an email to <%= ENV['GMAIL_ADDRESS'] %> with "explain" in the subject line. We'll forward you question to the list, WITHOUT your name or email address.
