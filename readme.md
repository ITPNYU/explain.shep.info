Explain.shep.info is deisgned to let mailing list subscribers send confidential questions about content FROM a particular mailing list back TO that mailing list, with a request for explanation.

Scenario:

1. User KnowItAll sends a mail to the list saying "AFAIC, this idea is a CWOT; FWIW, TANSTAFL. (YMMV.) L8R D00D3Z."

2. This message is distributed to all the recipients of the list. User IJustGotHere reads this message and says to himself "ZOMG wtf to all those acronyms mean!"

3. User IJustGotHere then forwards the message to shep@shep.info, with the subject line [explain].

4. When shep@shep.info receives the message, it records the email, data and sender, and puts the body of the message in a database.

5. When there are N or more messages (N > 2, at this point) or H hours have passed afger the message was delivered (H == 48 at this point), shep then sends the body of the email back to the mailing list, *without the original user's name* (or users' names, in the case of multiple messages), under the subject line [Please Explain] and a header that reads:

6. "One of your fellow list members found the following hard to understand. Would someone be willing to offer an explanation? if so, reply to this email with your explanation. Thanks, Shep."
